The frontend of the user as shown above displays several options(bottom left) for the user to decide the features of different insurance policies.
<br /> Insurance polices are then narrowed down for the user. The user can then click on the specific policy to be redirected to the Insurance Companies website and apply for the same.

The backend is a local blockchain launched on Ganache using the truffle suite. Smart contracts written using Solidity are deployed on to this chain to maintain data about the insurance policies.
<br />As shown above, new blocks are created everytime a user interacts with the blockchain by fetching information
